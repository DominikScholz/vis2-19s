<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
    Satellite data comes in the form of a Two-Line Element (TLE) set (<a href="#">Figure 1</a>), a format that describe
    a satellite's orbital elements.

    TLE can be used to find a satellite's position in space, but it is highly non-human-readable.

    Additionally, this data (provided by, e.g., <a href="https://sscweb.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/">SSCWeb</a> and
    <a href="https://www.space-track.org/documentation#/api">Space-Track.org</a>) is provided in large numbers
    (approximately 17.000 satellites).
</p>

<p>
    For that reason, current satellite visualization applications struggle to provide effective exploration tools.

    Real-Time Interactive Satellite Tracker (RTIST) is a tool for the exploration of earth's satellites.

    Using techniques such as brushing, dynamic queries and details on demand, this application enables users to
    visualize only the satellites they are interested in. <span class="todo">Sounds bad. Elaborate</span>
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>
    The features of RTIST are all implemented with visualization principles in mind, aiming to accelerate and
    facilitate the user's insight gaining process.

    In the following sections, these features are presented.
</p>

<h3>Real time tracking</h3>
<p>
    In order to deliver a reasonably accurate visualization of satellites and, at the same time, smooth the user's
    interactions (crucial for exploration applications), RTIST periodically fetches TLE data from online providers.

    For a given short time interval <span class="todo">How much time?</span>, the satellite's velocity is used to estimate its
    position.
</p>

<p>
    After each short interval, every satellite's new position and velocity are calculated based on the cached TLE data.

    This is done multiple times for a longer time interval <span class="todo">How much time?</span>, after which the TLE data is fetched again.
</p>

<h3>Brushing</h3>
<p>
    The implemented brushing tool enables the user to select a point the earth's surface, from which the satellites in
    a given radius are selected.

    This selection is visualized in the form of a cone, as shown in <a href="#">Figure 2</a>.

    With this tool, users can brush over a region on earth (countries, continents) and find all satellites currently
    over the defined area.
